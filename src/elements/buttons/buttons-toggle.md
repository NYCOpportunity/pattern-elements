The Toggle Button uses the [Toggle Utility](toggle) for expanding and collapsing a single content area. It rotates the downward-facing chevron icon to indicate that the area is expanded or collapsed. It also toggles the appropriate `aria-expanded`, `aria-hidden`, and `tabindex` of the target element and its potentially focusable child elements to hide it from screen readers.
