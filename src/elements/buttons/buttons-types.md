Button Types help designate specific usability patterns. The rules guiding the designation of types are not strict, but here is some guidance on how to use the different types in the {{ this.package.nice }}.

---

The **Styled Button** is the first styling level used to designate in-page functionality or linking. It is commonly used when the unstyled button doesn’t have a strong enough presence, and its functionality is not as important as other buttons.

---

The **Primary Button** is commonly used for in-page functionality. It should be reserved for the most important action on a page or viewport. Primary buttons may more commonly have an [icon prefix](#functional-buttons) to help designate the functionality.

---

The **Secondary Button** is commonly used for links and call-to-actions that take users to another page. Examples can be seen in [Card](card) and [Accordion](accordion) components. Secondary buttons may more commonly have an [icon postfix](#link-buttons), as described below.

---

The **Tertiary Button** should be reserved for in-page functionality, links, or call-to-actions that are unique or not typically available on the website. For example, if a user’s attention needs to be drawn to a particular link with timely information during an emergency.
