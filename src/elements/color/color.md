The {{ this.package.nice }} color system enforces a predefined set of combinations created to be inclusive for people with vision impairments. The combinations have been...

* Tested for adequate color contrast meeting **Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1 AA** compliance.

* Tested for **perceived color contrast**.

* Tested through simulation to **accommodate color blindness**.

There are two color palettes available for users to choose, light or dark, based on their preference (using the [theme utility](/theme)). They are both made of a **base color scale** with a split complementary set of **primary, secondary, and tertiary** colors.
