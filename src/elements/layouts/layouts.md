Layouts in the {{ this.package.nice }} are based on the {{ this.tokens.grid }} grid system. This means all dimensions and spacing between elements are determined by multiplying the value of {{ this.tokens.grid }}. The base value is stored in the `--nyco-grid` CSS custom property then other custom properties use the `calc()` CSS function to multiply it. There are also some [layout utilities](#layout-utilities) as well as a few basic predefined layouts.
