The **Sidebar Layout** creates a two-column container. The first element, the sidebar region, will have a maximum width of `{{ this.tokens.dimension.sidebar-width }}`. The second element will stretch to the end of the layout's container.

It is recommended to use a responsive utility prefix (`small:`, `mobile:`, `tablet:`, or `desktop:`) with the `layout-content` class to only enforce the layout in larger devices.
