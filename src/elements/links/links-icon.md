Links with icons in the Opportunity Standard use the class `link-icon` on the link and `icon` on the SVG icon. A `span` element is also required around the label. This helps center icons with the label and add a small amount of space between the label and the icon. Icons may be added on either side of the label.

Links with an icon but without text labels are discouraged. The icon and text label combination is the most certain way of communicating the meaning of the icon.
