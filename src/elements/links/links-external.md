External links should use the external link icon. *Internal* links lead to content on the same website or domain name (including the subdomain). **External** content exists in an entirely separate domain.

Internal content should generally open in the *existing window*, and external content may open in a **new tab**. Test with users or follow the guidance from Nielson Norman Group on <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/new-browser-windows-and-tabs/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">"Opening Links in New Browser Windows and Tabs."</a>

New browser or tab links should include the `rel` attribute with a value of `nofollow noopener` per CityWide Application Security guidelines.
