Guidance on links can be found on the <a href="https://designsystem.digital.gov/components/link/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">U.S. Web Design System (USWDS) site</a>. Links within the Opportunity Standard emphasize the following guidelines from the <abbr title="The U.S. Web Design System">USWDS</abbr>;

---

* Don’t rely on color alone to distinguish links.

* Clearly identify external links.

* Use unique, meaningful link text

---

Additionally, links within the Opportunity Standard encourage the following practices;

---

* Visited links are the same color as their parent element (`inherit`) so that they stand out but aren’t as obvious as unvisited links (if a color is desired to distinguish visited links, use a shade of purple, or similar to the browser default color for visited links).

* Per <a href="https://blueprint.cityofnewyork.us/content/plain-language-and-readability/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">plain language guidelines</a>, normal case is preferred over all caps for text labels.

* Links with an icon but without text labels are discouraged.

* New browser or tab links should include the `rel` attribute with a value of `nofollow noopener` per  CityWide Application Security guidelines.

* If a link wraps text at the end of a sentence, the period should be excluded from the `a` tag.

* If a link wraps quoted text, it must include both quotes in order for quotations to be rendered correctly.
