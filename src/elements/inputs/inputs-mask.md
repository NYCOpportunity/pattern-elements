Input Masks are recommended to help users type commonly formatted types such as telephone numbers, following guidance from the <a href="https://designsystem.digital.gov/components/input-mask/">U.S. Web Design Systemâ€™s Input Mask</a>. The {{ this.package.nice }} does not provide input masking support. However, the open source library <a target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow" href="https://nosir.github.io/cleave.js/">Cleave.js</a> is included as a dependency and is used on the [Share Form](share-form).
