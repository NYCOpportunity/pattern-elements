Block Nav elements are stacked on top of each other.

---

Block and Inline nav layouts can be swapped out using responsive utility prefix; `small:`, `mobile:`, `tablet:`, or `desktop:`. For example, `nav-block tablet:nav-inline` will display the nav as block for smaller viewports and inline for viewports larger than a tablet.
