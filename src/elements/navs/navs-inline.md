Navs are related collections of links, buttons, or other utilities. They always use the `nav` element. In the {{ this.package.nice }} they can either be inlined in a row or stacked on top of each other as a [Block Nav](#block-nav).

---

Each `nav` element must have a unique `aria-label` attribute to help screen readers distinguish them from other `nav` elements. Common `nav` labels in the {{ this.package.nice }} include;

* "Primary," used by the [Navigation Pattern](navigation).

* "Breadcrumb," used by the [Breadcrumb Element](breadcrumb).

* "Footer Navigation," present in the [Attribution (Footer) Pattern](attribution).

* "Site Map and Legal Information," present in the [Attribution (Footer) Pattern](attribution).
